Laboratory
==========

A Python library for carefully refactoring critical paths with support for Python 2.7 & 3.4+

Laboratory is all about sure-footed refactoring achieved through experimentation. By conducting
experiments and verifying their results, not only can we see if our refactored code is
misbehaving, we have established a feedback loop to help us correct its behaviour.

Quickstart
----------

See: :ref:`installation` or ``pip install laboratory``


With Laboratory you conduct an experiment with your known-good code as the
control block and a new code branch as a candidate.


Let's do an experiment together::

    import laboratory

    # create an experiment
    experiment = laboratory.Experiment()

    # set your control and candidate functions
    experiment.control(authorise_control, args=(user,))
    experiment.candidate(authorise_candidate, args=(user,))

    # conduct the experiment and return the control value
    authorised = experiment.conduct()

Laboratory just:

-  Executed the unproven (candidates) and the existing (control) code
-  Compared the return values
-  Recorded timing information about all code
-  Caught (and logged) exceptions in the unproven code
-  Published all of this information (see :ref:`publishing`)

For the most part that's all there is to it. You'll need to do some work to :ref:`publish your results <publishing>`
in order to act on the experiment, but if you've got a metrics solution ready to go it should be straightforward.

If you need to `control comparison`_, you can do that too.

.. Tip::

    Your control and candidate functions execute in a random order to help catch ordering issues
